My name is Becca McCaskey. I am married to my soulmate, Alex, and I am a first time mom to my sweet son John.  I have always been an avid blog-reader, but since giving birth to John in November, I cannot tell you how many “mom blogs” I have browsed during a 2 AM feeding in search of answers to various questions, such as “What is colic and why won’t my baby stop screaming!?” or “How to houdini swaddle my baby so he can’t break free?”

I have found so much peace and comfort in finding other moms who are struggling with the same real life issues and joys that come with raising a baby. 

As well as raising my sweet boy, I have a passion for all things southern. I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee and after a short adventure living in Long Beach, California for an internship and living in Memphis to complete graduate school, I have been back in Knoxville since 2014 and am so happy to be raising my family in this beautiful city, which I love more and more everyday. 

Last year, I converted to Catholicism through the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) process. I have never looked back, and have become fascinated with catholic theology and delving into the moral and ethical standings of the church. It is so important for my husband and I to teach John to be strong, ethical, respectful, and hopefully become a faithful Catholic man one day. I am in my infancy, just like John, in my growth as a catholic, and am learning as I go. 

This blog is a personal yet public diary of sorts, as you will find posts covering any and all things family, southern and catholic.

 My goal for making this “diary” public is that you can find laughter, hope, reassurance or simply enjoy a break from the hustle and bustle of your day. 

I hope you enjoy and feel free to reach out and say hello!
