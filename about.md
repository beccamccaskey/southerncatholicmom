I'm Becca. I'm a pediatric occupational therapist and have a huge passion for helping kiddos. I married my sweet husband, Alex, in January 2016 and had my sweet baby John 10 months later. I've had a whirlwind of a year, but am loving every minute. 

Currently, my passion for kids is focused on raising my baby. Hoping to share some of my experiences and adventures with other mammas and women out there! 

Cheers!
